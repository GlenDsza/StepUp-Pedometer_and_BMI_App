    <string name="bmi_info">Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of relative weight based on an individual\'s weight and height. BMI provides a simple numeric measure of a person\'s thickness or thinness, allowing health professionals to discuss overweight and underweight problems. It has been shown that for every five-point increase in BMI, your risk of death increases 31%. However BMI cannot be used as a sole indicator for disease-risk.</string>
